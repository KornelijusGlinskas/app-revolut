# Revolut Queue App

Every single day we have to be in some kind of queues - at bank, hospitals, posts, live support chats and etc. Wouldn't be great if we not only get a ticket with the number but also we would be able to see how much time left to wait until our turn? Well, from now Revolut made it possible. ü•≥ Once you register for meeting with the selected specialist, you immediately able to track how much waiting time is left. In that way, you can organize your time even better! üïñ

‚ùóÔ∏è Ô∏èP.S Famous tech giants were fascinated by the idea so they joined to Revolut as specialists. üòÇ Curious who? Go to https://kornelijusglinskas.github.io/app-revolut and register for a meeting!
